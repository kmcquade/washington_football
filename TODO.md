# TODO

This is where I list out some things I'm still trying to learn with Python delivery. Since I use this as a test repository it helps to list it out here.

### Immediate

* Distributing via custom homebrew tap.

### In the future

* Figure out how to deal with the damn hyphens in package installation names
* Figure out how to Git commit and Git push master from TravisCI when homebrew is modified
* Implement Codeowners file
* Push to Docker from Travis
* ZSH and Bash completion as homebrew package?
